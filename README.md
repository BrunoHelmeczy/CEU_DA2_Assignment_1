### Data folder: 
**Raw data set** 
- Covid-19 data is obtained from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data, originating from Johns Hopkins Universitys' Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard.
- Listed countries' populations (as of 2019) are also included in this analysis, downloaded from the World Banks'- World Development Indicators, & available at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL. 

**Cleaned data set** 
- Contains countries' Covid-19 figures as of 20th October, 2020, including confirmed-, death-, recovered-, & active cases from 182 listed countries.
- Confirmed- & Death cases also include probable cases, if such data is reported in a country. 
- Active cases are calculated as the total confirmed cases minus deaths, minus recovered cases. 
- Covid-19 related figures were all scaled by 1.000, while countries' population figures were scaled by 1.000.000.

### Codes folder:
The codes folder includes the following:
- **Download_raw_Covid_n_Pop_data.R:** this is the R script that collects all the data used in this analysis.
- **Clean_n_Merge_Covid_n_Pop_data.R:** this is the R script that contains the steps of cleaning the data set before doing analysis.
- **Analysis_Covid_n_Pop_data.R:** this is the R script with all the analysis part of this project.
- **DA2_Assignment1_Report.Rmd:** same as covid_analysis _data.R but in .Rmd. You should be able to replicate my results by running this Rmd file.

### Docs folder: 
- **.html** & **.pdf** reports - generated from **DA2_Assignment1_Report.Rmd**.
